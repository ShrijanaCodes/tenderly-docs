# Simulation API Placeholder

As developed, robust and usable as Tenderly features are, we must admit that our documentation is somewhat lagging behind in some aspects. That is why we are working hard on producing more in-depth doc articles, code examples and use cases for our features, so our users (aka you) don't have to waste any time figuring out how to use Tenderly and everything the platform is capable of.

Simulation API is currently in our focus, and the materials are coming (really) soon  ðŸ™Œ

You can check out the [plans and pricing for the Simulation API here](../other/simulation-api-rate-limits.md). You can also check out all [Public API endpoints here](https://docs-api.tenderly.co) - this documentation space is under continuous development, so if you need some API endpoints that aren't available or other API needs that aren't listed publicly, please ping us via [**Intercom on the Tenderly Dashboard**](https://dashboard.tenderly.co) **** and we'll do our best to meet your needs ðŸ––
