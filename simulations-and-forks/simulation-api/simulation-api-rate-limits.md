# Simulation API Rate Limits

You can check out pre-defined Tenderly pricing plans on our[ pricing page](https://tenderly.co/pricing/).

### Dev Plan Simulation API

**Dev Plan** Simulation API starts with the initial limits:

* 100 simulations/minute.
* Daily Simulation API limit is capped at 330 simulations (or forks)/day.

If you have a need for an increased usage rate, monthly or daily limit, **please contact us via email (**[**support@tenderly.co**](mailto:support@tenderly.co)**) as we are offering custom usage and rate limit-based Tiers** to suit your needs.

### **Pro Plan Simulation API**

**Pro Plan** Simulation API starts with the initial limits, which 10 collaborators can share:

* 100 simulations/minute.
* Daily Simulation API limit is capped at 2.000 simulations (or forks)/day.
* Monthly Simulation API limit is capped at 12.400 simulations (or forks)/month.

If you have a need for an increased usage rate, monthly or daily limit, **please contact us via email (**[**support@tenderly.co**](mailto:support@tenderly.co)**) as we are offering custom usage and rate limit-based Tiers** to suit your needs.

### Simulation API Add-on Tiers

If you are on any of the paid plans (Dev, Pro or Custom), and you have a need for:

* A greater number of simulations per period than your plan allows (monthly or daily), or
* Bigger simulation throughput (per minute)&#x20;

You can upgrade the number of simulations which are available to you at any point, without upgrading your whole plan, by choosing one of the Simulation API Add-on Tiers on your billing page - you can follow this link:

These add-ons will raise the number of simulations which are available to you and/or raise the simulation throughput. If none of these tiers suit you, you can always ping us via Intercom or via email ([**support@tenderly.co**](mailto:support@tenderly.co)) so we can define a plan that works for your exact needs.
