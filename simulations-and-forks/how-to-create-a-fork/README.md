# How to Create a Fork

{% hint style="success" %}
Forks allow you to chain [**Simulations**](../how-to-simulate-a-transaction/) and test out complex scenarios with live on-chain data.
{% endhint %}

Let's start up a new Fork:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.22.17.png>)

Choose the network you want to fork and name it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.23.24.png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.24.00.png>)

You can choose the block from which you want to fork the chosen network, either latest or historical ([**read more about that here**](../how-to-simulate-a-transaction/pending-vs-historical-block.md)):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.25.01.png>)

Regardless of the chosen block, we can now create a new fork simulation:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.27.32.png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.35.01.png>)

You can use either public or [**custom contracts**](../how-to-simulate-a-transaction/transaction-parameters.md) here as well:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-15 at 10.39.25.png>)

All that is left to do is fill out the fork simulation parameters, click **Simulate Transaction** and that's it - you can now run as many simulations as you want on your fork!
