# How to Get a Fork JSON-RPC URL & ID

You may need a Tenderly Fork ID and JSON-RPC URL at various stages of your development process, from setting up a staging environment to verifying contracts deployed on a Fork.

Learn how to find this information from the Tenderly Dashboard in just a few simple steps.

## Access the Fork page

Once in the Tenderly dashboard, go to the Fork section in the navigation bar on the left:

![Access the fork page](../../.gitbook/assets/image3)

This page will open a list of your existing Forks. Click the Fork you're currently working with to access its ID and JSON-RPC URL.

![Forks page](../../.gitbook/assets/image4)

## Get the JSON-RPC URL

The next window will open detailed information about your preferred Fork, including the JSON-RPC URL:

![Selected fork page](../../.gitbook/assets/image5)

**The JSON-RPC URL in this example**: [https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/9c9a829b-01fb-4c68-8d7b-fcb9d7afdd95](https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/9c9a829b-01fb-4c68-8d7b-fcb9d7afdd95)

Copy the URL by clicking it or navigating to the following button:

![Copying the JSON-RPC URL](../../.gitbook/assets/image2)

## Extract the Fork ID

Next, extract the Fork ID from the JSON-RPC URL. The ID is the last part of the URL:

![The Fork ID part](../../.gitbook/assets/image1)

**The Fork ID in this example**: 9c9a829b-01fb-4c68-8d7b-fcb9d7afdd95

After gathering the Fork information you need, you can use it in your project.
