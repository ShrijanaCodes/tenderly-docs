  Learn how to persist simulation data on Tenderly and use it to examine failed
  or successfully executed transaction simulations.

# Easily Debug Failed Transactions

By default, transactions executed via API donâ€™t persist on Tenderly and aren't visible in the Dashboard. When executing simulations, you probably want to examine them in greater detail.

When running a transaction simulation, you can provide the `save_if_fails` flag. So, if a failure takes place, the simulation data will be persisted in the Tenderly Dashboard.

If you need to save the simulation of a successfully executed transaction, you can set the `save` flag (`false` by default).

Additionally, the response you receive contains the simulation ID (`simulation.id`), so you can generate a link directly to Tenderly Debugger. This helps you speed up the time needed to understand and fix a bug or any other issue that is present in the smart contract.

```tsx
...
const { TENDERLY_USER, TENDERLY_PROJECT, TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY } = process.env;

const body = {
  "network_id": "1",
  "from": senderAddr,
  "to": contract.address,
  "input": unsignedTx.data,
  "gas": 21204,
  "gas_price": "0",
  "value": 0,
  "save_if_fails": true
}

const opts = {
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/JSON',
    'X-Access-Key': TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY,
  }
}
const resp = await axios.post(apiURL, body, opts);

if (simulation.status == "failed") {
  const link = `https://dashboard.tenderly.co/project/${TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG}/simulator/${resp.data.simulation.id}`
  // trigger sentry, log error, make the test fail if in test
}
```
