# Editing Contract Source

You can edit the contract source on the fly while setting up your simulation or re-simulating, by showing the entire code and giving access to any line or parameter you would want to change.

**This means almost instant testing of bug fixes, changing parameters to test the outcome on-chain or doing anything you want with the contract source code (either custom or public).**

You can also change the following compiler parameters for the simulation execution:

* Compiler Version
* Optimization Used
* Optimization Count
* EVM Version

One more great feature is that you can **add a custom contract source to any contract you have chosen to edit (or any address in fact)** by clicking on _add contract source_ and choosing any of the deployed contracts to use it's source code:

You can also type your smart contract source code from scratch for any address in this way:

All of this means that you can test any custom contract you want with live production data.
