# Verifying Private Contracts

When a contract is verified, it gets published on our [public contract listing](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public-contracts?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=debugging_verifying&utm_content=public_contracts) for everyone to see.

You can verify your Smart Contracts by using our CLI. If you don’t have our CLI already installed, you can follow the [installation steps on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/tenderly/tenderly-cli#installation). After the CLI is set up, navigate to your project and type in:

```text
tenderly verify
```

That’s it! Your Smart Contracts are now verified with Tenderly and publicly monitored!
