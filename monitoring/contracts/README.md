# Transaction Overview

When you enter your project, the first thing that you see is the **Transactions** tab:

Here you can find the list of all of the transactions that include any of your Smart Contracts. **Yes, that means both direct and internal transactions**.

We also backfill all of the transactions that happened before you added your Smart Contracts to Tenderly.

You can also choose which columns will be shown on the transaction overview screen:
