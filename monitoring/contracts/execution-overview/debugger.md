# Stack Traces \(Debugger\)

Stack traces are a very import part of any developer's workflow both locally, but in production as well. That's why Stack traces [were one of the first features](http://blog.tenderly.co/improving-smart-contract-development-with-tenderly-and-human-readable-stack-traces/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=10_ways&utm_content=first_features) we released, first as a [CLI tool](https://github.com/Tenderly/tenderly-cli) and later as part of our platform.

[**The stack trace above**](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/main/0x66016977d78e01a8ff0609f14ec6fc8caf95db6c666e86ac589bd76942688db0?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=10_ways&utm_content=stack_trace) **shows the exact line of code where the transaction failed**. From there, you can click **Debug Error** and find the issue in no time! How convenient!
