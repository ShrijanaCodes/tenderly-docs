# Events

Smart Contract Events are the de-facto way of notifying interested parties that some event has occurred. The Logs themselves also contain valuable information in addition to the information that a particular event has occurred.

When we open the **Events/Logs** tool, we can see all of the Logs that were [emitted during a transaction](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/main/0x97c37f37988c010a37a8c550b03af37c04bffa2ba6be7d1135f0a26c0e00f532/logs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=10_ways&utm_content=events_logs). What is even better is that **the event parameters are already decoded and shown in a human-readable format**. No more time wasted decoding hex strings to see what happened. You can also filter the Events by name and Smart Contract. Time: saved!
