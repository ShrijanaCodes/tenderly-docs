Execution Overview - think of it as the bird's-eye view of the transaction. At a glance, you can see the exact code paths of all of the Smart Contracts that participated in a given transaction. You can open the transaction from the image above by [clicking here](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/main/0x97c37f37988c010a37a8c550b03af37c04bffa2ba6be7d1135f0a26c0e00f532?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=10_ways&utm_content=execution_overview).

When you click on a function name, you can see the context in which that function was called:
