# Wallets

Tenderly now supports **Wallets** as well as [**Contracts**](../smart-contracts/), which means you can use the all-in-one Tenderly platform with any wallet address!

## Adding a Wallet to Tenderly

In either a new or existing project, there's a new **Wallets** tab in the left navigation bar. Paste any public wallet address into the search bar to find a wallet:

Initially, only wallets with an existing balance will be shown, but clicking the **Show All** button **** will display the list of all other wallets for the address with zero balance:

You can choose one or more wallets to be added to your project:

On the **Wallets** page, you can see the wallet(s) you added and their key info:

* Wallet name
* Address
* Network
* Visibility
* Type

## Wallet Actions

When you click on a wallet, you'll see key wallet info and use all of the Tenderly features to perform various actions:

**View Transactions** takes you to the [**Transactions**](../contracts/) **** page with a pre-applied filter for your wallet:

****[**Simulate Transaction**](../../simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/) **** opens up the transaction simulation flow with the `From` field pre-filled with the wallet address in question.

**Configure Alert** opens up the standard alerting flow.&#x20;

**Add on More Networks** opens up the add wallet flow so you can add wallets from that address on other networks as well.

You can also **Rename**, **Hide,** or **Remove** your wallet at any time.
