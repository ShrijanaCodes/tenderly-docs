# Wallets

Tenderly now supports **Wallets **as well as **Contracts**, which means you can now use all of Tenderly platform features with any wallet address, so let's go over all of the features.

## Adding a Wallet to Tenderly

In either new or existing project, there is a new **Wallets **tab in the left navigation bar - paste any public wallet address (EOA) in to the search bar to add the wallet to your project:

Initially only wallets with an existing balance will be shown, but clicking on **Show All **you will see the list of all other wallets for the address with zero balance:

You can choose one or more wallets to be imported into your project:

* Visibility
* Type

**Configure Alert **opens up the standard alerting flow with your wallet as the alert target.
