# Wallet Tags

You can add custom tags to any of your wallets in order to make labelling clearer as well as to help you filter your transactions and pinpoint key events that happened more easily.

Now, when you filter any transaction(s) in the [Transactions Tab](../contracts/), besides other filters you can also filter by the wallet tags you defined, as well as choose whether to show all transactions in the defined date range or just ones that executed after the tag was created. All of the tags that you created for all wallets will be available in the dropdown.

You can define as many tags for one wallet as you want, as well as use the same tag on multiple wallets for whatever reason you may need it.
