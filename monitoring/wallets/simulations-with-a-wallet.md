When you start up a new [**Simulation**](../../simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/), you will be able to choose between the default and custom **from** address:

* Default `from` address allows you to simulate a transaction with any amount and any currency without actually defining a specific wallet.
* Custom `from` address allows you to paste any wallet address into the **From** field or select one of the project wallets on the chosen network:

By changing the network the list of the wallets in the **From** field will change accordingly, if it exists on the chosen network:
