# Converting Contracts into Wallets

We can start by adding any contract into our project:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-14 at 13.50.09.png>)

By going into the **Contracts** tab on the left and clicking on the contract we added, we will get the contract overview with a new option - **Convert to Wallet**:

You can see that we now have two wallet types - EOA and **Contract Wallet**. The difference between them is that we can convert the contract wallet back to a contract at any point:

You can also convert contract into wallets straight from the add wallet flow:

The same thing applies for contract wallets in the add contract flow:
