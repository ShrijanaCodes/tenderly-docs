# How to Generate API Access Tokens

This guide shows you how to generate access tokens to authenticate access to the [**Tenderly API**](https://docs-api.tenderly.co/) and [**Hardhat Plugin**](https://github.com/Tenderly/hardhat-tenderly).

To proceed, you need to have a Tenderly account. If you donâ€™t have one already, register for a free account on the [**signup page**](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/register).

## Generate an API access token for a personal account

Follow the steps below to generate an access token for the API for your personal account.

* Open up your **Tenderly Dashboard.**
* Click on your profile photo from the top nav bar.
* From the dropdown, click on **Settings**.
* Next, navigate to the **Authorization** tab.
* Click the **General Access Token** button.
* Give your new access tokens a descriptive label to keep things organized.

This is helpful if you need to generate multiple API access tokens for use in different places.

* Click **Generate**.

You will be prompted to copy your private key. For security reasons, the private key will be displayed only once during the initial creation. Copy your private key and store it in a safe place.

* Once youâ€™ve copied the private key, click **Okay, close.**
