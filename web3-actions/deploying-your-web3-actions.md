# Deploying your Web3 Actions

After you have configured your action, just run `tenderly actions deploy` and you can go to your project in the dashboard to see your available actions. If you just want to check your configuration without deploying new version, use `tenderly actions build`.

### Manual Run

Deployed action can be manually run through the dashboard. Navigate to the specific action and click the **Manual Trigger** button. You can provide any payload you want, as long as it matches the required schema.
