To invite someone to your project, go to the **Collaborators** tab and click **Add Collaborator**.

There you'll be able to pick the permissions the newly added Collaborator has for this project.

After you click **Add Collaborator**, an e-mail with the invitation is sent immediately.

And don't worry, if your friend doesn't have a Tenderly account, they will be on-boarded and added to your project in less then a minute!
