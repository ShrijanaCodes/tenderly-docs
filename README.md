# General Info

[**Tenderly**](https://tenderly.co) is a comprehensive **Ethereum Developer Platform** for real-time monitoring, alerting, debugging, and simulating Smart Contracts.



### Some of the notable features Tenderly supports:

****[**Transaction filtering**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/transaction-overview.md)****

Sort and group transactions by any parameter you want and make it easier to explore and analyze robust data.

****[**Visual Debugger**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/)****

Inspect the transaction execution with a couple of clicks and instantly find the line your transaction reverted on.

****[**State Inspector**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/)****

See the state of your contract at any point in a transaction and explore state changes in a granular view.

****[**Smart Contract Analytics**](analytics/general-analytics.md)****

Visualize and analyze the behaviour of your Smart Contract to spot patterns and gain a deeper insight into transaction data.

****[**Real-time Alerting**](broken-reference)****

Any time an event triggers your custom set of rules you will receive a notification on your favorite channels like Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc.

****[**Gas Profiler**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/)****

Get a granular gas usage breakdown to help you optimize your Smart Contracts and lower the gas cost of your transactions.

****[**Simulations**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/)****

Know how your transactions will behave before you execute them, estimate the gas usage and test potential bug fixes.

****[**Forks**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-create-a-fork.md)****

Take your simulations a step further by creating a temporary fork of any supported network and execute multiple transactions in a row to test their behaviour.

****[**Integrations**](simulations-and-forks/integrations.md)****

Use our powerful API to access real-time blockchain data necessary for your business. Integrate Tenderly with your product to deliver more value faster.
