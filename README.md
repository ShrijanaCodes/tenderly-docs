# ðŸ“£ General Info

[**Tenderly**](https://tenderly.co) is a comprehensive **Ethereum Developer Platform** for real-time monitoring, alerting, debugging, and simulating Smart Contracts.



**Some of the notable features that Tenderly supports:**

****[**Web3 Actions**](web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions.md)&#x20;

Run your code in response to on-chain (or even off-chain) events, usually on your smart contracts.&#x20;

You can use Web3 Actions to create custom scenarios in order to further deepen your debugging process, create alerting patterns that are not available out-of-the-box in the [**Alerting**](alerts/creating-an-alert/) section, automating testing or live production execution in the [**Simulator**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/) and [**Forks**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-create-a-fork/), or anything else that comes to (your) mind.

****[**Wallet Monitoring**](monitoring/wallets/)

Use all of Tenderly platform features with any wallet address!

****[**Transaction filtering**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/transaction-overview.md)****

Sort and group transactions by any parameter you want and make it easier to explore and analyze robust data.

****[**Visual Debugger**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/)****

Inspect the transaction execution with a couple of clicks and instantly find the line your transaction reverted on.

****[**State Inspector**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/)****

See the state of your contract at any point in a transaction and explore state changes in a granular view.

****[**Smart Contract Analytics**](analytics/general-analytics.md)****

Visualize and analyze the behaviour of your Smart Contract to spot patterns and gain a deeper insight into transaction data.

****[**Real-time Alerting**](broken-reference)****

Any time an event triggers your custom set of rules you will receive a notification on your favorite channels like Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc.

****[**Gas Profiler**](debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger/)****

Get a granular gas usage breakdown to help you optimize your Smart Contracts and lower the gas cost of your transactions.

****[**Simulations**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/)****

Know how your transactions will behave before you execute them, estimate the gas usage and test potential bug fixes. **You can also find extensive Simulation API documentation here:**

{% endcontent-ref %}

****[**Forks**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-create-a-fork/)****

Take your simulations a step further by creating a temporary fork of any supported network and execute multiple transactions in a row to test their behaviour.

****[**Integrations**](monitoring/integrations.md)****

Use our powerful API to access real-time blockchain data necessary for your business. Integrate Tenderly with your product to deliver more value faster.
