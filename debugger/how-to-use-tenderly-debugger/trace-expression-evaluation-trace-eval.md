# Trace Expression Evaluation (Trace Eval)

You can now evaluate expressions in the execution trace! Go to any transaction in the "Transactions" in the left-hand navigation, then go to the "Debugger" tab, and click on the "Evaluate" button:

The Eval feature is currently only supported for Solidity contracts, and we're working on supporting Eval for Vyper contracts as well. Choose any expression you want to evaluate, paste it into the box and hit the `Evaluate` button:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-04-14 at 12.44.57.png>)

This works for both simple and complex expressions:
