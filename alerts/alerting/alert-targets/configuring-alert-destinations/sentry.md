# Sentry



It is pretty straightforward when it comes to adding a new alert destination but let's go over it. On your Tenderly Dashboard go to **Alerting,** which can be found under **Monitoring**, choose the **Destinations** tab:

* Now that you can see all the available Destinations pick **Sentry.** 
* A window will pop-up which will ask you for your DSN Address and a Label for you to choose \("You can find your project’s DSN in the “**Client Keys**” section of your “**Project Settings**” in Sentry"\).
