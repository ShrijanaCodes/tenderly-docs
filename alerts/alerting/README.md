# Webhook Notifications

## The Problem

In traditional development, your software is your system, so everything happening inside that system is of interest to you. Then came blockchain and there was this huge paradigm shift where your software (Smart Contracts) is just a part of an ever-expanding system whose parts are continuously interacting with each other.

All of this noise makes it hard to see what's happening with your Smart Contracts. What’s even scarier is that if you don’t actively monitor your Smart Contracts, you’ll probably miss some critical activity that happened during execution.

## The Solution

With Tenderly, you can set up custom real-time Alerts and get notified when anything of your interest happens on the Ethereum blockchain in just a few clicks.

We run our own full nodes meaning that we process the blockchain in real-time. So, you can set up to receive alert notifications in real-time or at any interval that fits your needs (for example, every 15 min).

Tenderly integrates with your favourite apps and services. Each integration offers features that help track your Alerts.

#### All destinations are shared account-wide on all projects. If you edit or delete a destination, it will be applied to all projects and active rules. Check out how to [configure Alert destinations here.](alert-targets/configuring-alert-destinations.md)
