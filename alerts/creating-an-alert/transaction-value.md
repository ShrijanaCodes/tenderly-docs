#### Introduction

Triggers whenever a transaction value matches set conditions.

#### Example

Let’s get notified for every transaction above 100 Ether who called the selected contract.

* First of all, we need to add Smart Contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract\]** into Project.

* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—&gt;** **New Alert** **—&gt;** **Transaction Value —&gt; Contract —&gt; Select Contract —&gt;** Find Smart Contract and Choose it **—&gt;** Select comparator **`>`** **—&gt;** Enter **100000000000000000000** Wei **—&gt; Next —&gt;** Choose Alert Destination **—&gt; Save.** 
* That’s it! You’ll get a notification whenever the transaction with more than 100 Ether is called a selected contract. 
* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
