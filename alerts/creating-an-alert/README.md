# Creating an Alert

{% hint style="warning" %}
First of all, before creating an alert, we need to configure a destination. If you haven't done that yet, [check out how to configure Alert destinations.](../alerting/alert-targets/configuring-alert-destinations.md)

### Get an alert when a transaction fails

To get alerted whenever any of your Smart Contracts fail, make sure to follow these steps:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Creating an Alert for a failed transaction.gif>)

Once you set this up, you'll get an instant notification if a transaction fails. This way, you can act immediately instead of waiting for your dApp users to tell you that something isnâ€™t working. Take a look at the following Alert example:

### Test the created alerts

You can run a test for any new or existing alert to see how it will behave.

It's as simple as clicking the `Trigger Test Alert` button in the bottom left corner:

Choose the network you want to test your alert on (depending on whether your contract/wallet is multi-network or not). Next, paste the transaction hash for which you want to run the alert test (you can see all the transactions for any account):

If the alert test fails, you'll get the following notification:

If the alert test is successful, you'll get a notification in the bottom right corner of your screen. Go to **Alert History in the Alerts tab** for an overview of all the successful tests for your alert(s). They are clearly marked so you don't confuse them with the instances where your alert was actually triggered.

You can also click any alert to easily **Duplicate** it. Simply click the button in the bottom right corner, right next to **Edit**:

If you don't want your alert to trigger for whatever reason, you can **Disable** it instead of deleting it. Just click the button in the bottom left corner of the same screen:
