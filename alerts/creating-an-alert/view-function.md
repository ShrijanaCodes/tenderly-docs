#### Introduction

You can choose this alert type to get notified when a view function's _return value_ matches certain criteria, passes a threshold, or changes by a certain percentage.

#### Example

For instance, if you'd like to check the ERC20 balance threshold, follow these steps:&#x20;

* Use the “View function” Alert type.
* Select the contract address.&#x20;
* Pick the `balanceOf()` function set for the address about which you want to receive notifications.
* Set the preferred condition, such as a treshold below a certain value.&#x20;
