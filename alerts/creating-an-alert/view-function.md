# View Function

Get notified when a view function's _return value_ matches a certain criteria, passes a threshold or changes by a certain percentage.\
\
For example, if we want to check the ERC20 balance threshold we can use the “View function” Alert type, select the contract address, and pick `balanceOf()` function set for address for which we want to get the Alert. We then set a condition, for example a threshold below value, and that's it.
