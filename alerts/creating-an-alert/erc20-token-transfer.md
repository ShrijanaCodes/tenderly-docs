#### Introduction

Triggers whenever an ERC20 transfer event is emitted in one of your contracts.

#### Example

Let’s get notified every time someone sends us tokens.

*   First of all, we need to add the ERC20 Smart Contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract]** into Project.


* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—>** **New Alert** **—>** **ERC20 Token Transfer —> Contract —> Select Contract —>** Find Smart Contract and Choose it **—>** Select direction value to **"to" —>** Paste our address **—> Next —>** Choose Alert Destination **—> Save.**\
  ****
* That’s it! You’ll get a notification whenever someone sends you a selected ERC20 token.\

* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
