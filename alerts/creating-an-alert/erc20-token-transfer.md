{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/c1c44f9826ab4d96b0ed9eb0a0e84e5d" %}

#### Introduction

Triggers whenever an ERC20 transfer event is emitted in one of your contracts.

#### Example

Let’s get notified every time someone sends us tokens.

* First of all, we need to add the ERC20 Smart Contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract\]** into Project.

* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—&gt;** **New Alert** **—&gt;** **ERC20 Token Transfer —&gt; Contract —&gt; Select Contract —&gt;** Find Smart Contract and Choose it **—&gt;** Select direction value to **"to" —&gt;** Paste our address **—&gt; Next —&gt;** Choose Alert Destination **—&gt; Save.** 
* That’s it! You’ll get a notification whenever someone sends you a selected ERC20 token. 
* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
