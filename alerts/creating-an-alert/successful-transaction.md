#### Introduction

Trigger your alert whenever a successful transaction is created. You can set up different targets like when a transaction calls some contract, or more general like when the transaction is created on some network.

#### Example

Let’s say we have deployed some contracts and want to monitor every successful transaction that calls our contract.

* First of all, we need to add that contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract\]** into Project.

* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—&gt;** **New Alert** **—&gt;** **Successful Transaction —&gt; Contract —&gt; Select Contract —&gt;** Find Contract you want to monitor and Choose it **—&gt; Next —&gt;** Choose Alert Destination **—&gt; Save.** 
* That is it, Alert was created. Now we get notified instantly for each successful transaction. 
* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
