# Successful Transaction

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Choosing a successful transaction as an Alert.png>)

#### Introduction

Trigger your alert whenever a successful transaction is created. You can set up different targets such as when a transaction calls a specific contract or runs on a network of interest.

#### Example

Let’s say you've deployed a contract and want to monitor every successful transaction that calls it.

* First, you need to [add the contract to Projects in a few simple steps](https://docs.tenderly.co/monitoring/smart-contracts).
* Next, click **Alerting** in the left side bar **—>** **New Alert** **—>** **Successful Transaction —> Contract —> Select Contract  —>**Find and choose the Smart Contract you want to monitor **—> Next —>** Choose Alert Destination **—> Save.**
* That's it, you created an Alert that will notify you instantly for each successful transaction.
* When creating an Alert, you can easily change its name or add a description, alert level, and more alert destinations. To do this, simply [learn how to edit your Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/creating-an-alert/editing-an-alert).&#x20;
