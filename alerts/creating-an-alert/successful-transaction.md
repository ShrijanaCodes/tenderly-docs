# Successful transaction

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Successful-transaction.gif)

#### Introduction

Trigger your alert whenever a successful transaction is created. You can set up different targets like when a transaction calls some contract, or more general like when the transaction is created on some network.

#### Example

Let’s say we have deployed some contracts and want to monitor every successful transaction that calls our contract.

*   First of all, we need to add that contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract]** into Project.


* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—>** **New Alert** **—>** **Successful Transaction —> Contract —> Select Contract —>** Find Contract you want to monitor and Choose it **—> Next —>** Choose Alert Destination **—> Save.**\
  ****
* That is it, Alert was created. Now we get notified instantly for each successful transaction.\

* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
