# Whitelisted Callers

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Whitelisted-Callers.gif)

#### Introduction

Triggers whenever an address that is not whitelisted calls one of your contracts.

#### Example

Let’s get notified every time when someone who isn't on the whitelist calls our smart contract.

*   First of all, we need to add Smart Contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract]** into Project.


* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—>** **New Alert** **—>** **Whitelisted Callers —> Contract —> Select Contract —>** Find Smart Contract and Choose it **—>** Paste address and click on **Add** button **—> Next —>** Choose Alert Destination **—> Save.**\
  ****
* That’s it! You’ll get a notification whenever someone who has not whitelisted calls one of your contracts.\

* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
