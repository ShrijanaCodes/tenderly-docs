{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/d91bf4706166429ca5c8d2c3e3da71dd" %}

#### Introduction

Triggers whenever an address that is not whitelisted calls one of your contracts.

#### Example

Let’s get notified every time when someone who isn't on the whitelist calls our smart contract.

* First of all, we need to add Smart Contract to Project. You can see here how to **\[Add new contract\]** into Project.

* Click on **Alerting** in the navigation **—&gt;** **New Alert** **—&gt;** **Whitelisted Callers —&gt; Contract —&gt; Select Contract —&gt;** Find Smart Contract and Choose it **—&gt;** Paste address and click on **Add** button **—&gt; Next —&gt;** Choose Alert Destination **—&gt; Save.** 
* That’s it! You’ll get a notification whenever someone who has not whitelisted calls one of your contracts. 
* When Alert was created if we want to add a description, alert level, more alert destinations, or change the name, we can do that. You can see how in [Edit Alert](editing-an-alert.md).
