# Intro to Alerts



{% hint style="success" %}
**üéâ Webhooks released!**

You can now send Alert data to a webhook destination in real time and connect different external services and applications. Explore [**how webhooks work** ](configuring-alert-destinations.md#webhooks)and [**how to integrate webhooks into your project**](how-to-use-webhooks-for-alerting.md).
{% endhint %}

Tenderly Alerting listens for events on the blockchain and sends real-time notifications to your desired destination when the event occurs. This can be email, your favorite messaging app, an incident monitoring system, or webhooks and Web3 Actions.

With Tenderly Alerting, you can stay informed about desired or undesired events related to transitions, wallets, smart contracts, or any other activity on the network. This enables you to identify and resolve smart contract transaction issues faster. Alerts can also aid in the early detection of operational, code, or security issues.

## Anatomy of an Alert

Each Alert requires three elements to be configured before it can be enabled:

* **Alert Type:** On-chain event that triggers Tenderly to send you a notification. There are 12 alert trigger types to choose from.
* **Alert Target:** Addresses you want Tenderly to monitor, as well as other settings such as the network, project, and tags.
* **Alert Destination:** Service for receiving notifications about a specific event. One Alert can send notifications to multiple destinations. There are 8 destination types where you can send and receive notifications.

## Alert trigger types overview

Below is a list of all the Alert Types and a brief example of a common use case. Click the link to explore each trigger type in more detail.

| Trigger type                                                                                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Successful Transaction](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/creating-an-alert/successful-transaction) | Notifies you when a successful transaction happens. This is useful when you want to observe transactions from a wallet, dapp, or smart contract getting added to the blockchain.                                                         |
| [Failed Transaction](creating-an-alert/failed-transaction.md)                                      | Send a notification when a transition fails, allowing you to keep track of all the unsuccessful transitions and detect issues, as well as catch malfunctions with your dapp or smart contract early.                                     |
| [Function Call](creating-an-alert/function-call.md)                                                | Fires when a specific function is called from a contract, which is useful for monitoring the execution of smart contracts for potential issues.                                                                                          |
| [Event Emitted](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/creating-an-alert/successful-transaction)          | Triggers when a specific event is emitted from a contract. For example, this trigger can be used to monitor every time a spender is approved to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner.                                                  |
| [Event Parameter](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/creating-an-alert/event-parameter)               | Alerts you when an event parameter has a particular value. You can use this Alert trigger to monitor when a particular address is approved to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner.                                                    |
| [ERC20 Token Transfer](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/creating-an-alert/erc20-token-transfer)     | Triggers when an ERC20 transfer event is emitted from a contract, allowing you to track when you or someone moves tokens. This can be useful for monitoring suspicious wallets during or after an exploit.                               |
| [Allowlisted callers](creating-an-alert/whitelisted-callers.md)                                    | Notifies you when an address that is not on this list calls your smart contract. This Alert can be used for monitoring if an address outside the ‚Äúallowed‚Äù list attempts to call a function that‚Äôs reserved only for specific addresses. |
| [Blocklisted Callers](creating-an-alert/blacklisted-callers.md)                                    | Notifies you whenever an address from this list calls your contracts.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [ETH Balance](creating-an-alert/eth-balance.md)                                                    | Triggers when the ETH balance of an address falls below a threshold. If you are a member of a DAO that is governed by a smart contract, you can set up this alert to notify you when the DAO's balance falls below a certain threshold.  |
| [Transaction Value](creating-an-alert/transaction-value.md)                                        | Notifies you when a transaction value matches set conditions. This alert is useful in situations when a transaction with more than a certain amount of ETH calls a contract.                                                             |
| [State Change](creating-an-alert/state-change.md)                                                  | Fires when a state variable in a contract changes. This alert is ideal for monitoring when the number of required confirmations for a multisig wallet goes below a certain number.                                                       |
| [View Function](creating-an-alert/view-function.md)                                                | Alerts you when a view function's return value matches certain criteria, passes a threshold, or changes by a certain percentage. For instance, this Alert can be used if you want to check the ERC20 balance threshold.                  |
