# üîç Explorer

{% hint style="success" %}
This feature is available for both [**Contracts**](monitoring/smart-contracts/) and [**Wallets**](monitoring/wallets/) in Tenderly.
{% endhint %}

If you are not logged in into Tenderly, you can still use the **Tenderly Explorer** to search for addresses and transactions in order to gain some insights:

{% hint style="success" %}
Tenderly now automatically simulates the (expected) outcome of pending transactions when you paste the tx hash into the search bar, both in your [**Dashboard**](https://dashboard.tenderly.co) and in our [**Public Explorer**](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer).

This feature is available to all users, even if they are not logged in. That means that **you can now simulate live pending transactions** in this way even [**from our Explorer page**](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer) without having an account - but you really should make one (it's free) so you can use the full power of our [**Simulations**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-simulate-a-transaction/) **** and **** [**Forks**](simulations-and-forks/how-to-create-a-fork/) üöÄ

Read more about it [**here**](monitoring/contracts/simulating-a-pending-transaction.md).
